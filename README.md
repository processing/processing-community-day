# Processing Community Day Website

A global map of Processing Community Day events.

In 2026, Processing turns 25. To mark the occasion, Processing Community Day (PCD) returns as a worldwide celebration! PCD is a global network of community-led events that brings together artists, designers, technologists, educators, and open-source communities around the world.

For more information about PCD 2026 and how to get involved, see the [forum thread](https://discourse.processing.org/t/pcd-worldwide-2026-call-for-organizers/48081).

## About this project

For now it's a simple static map showcasing PCD events around the world. The goal is to have something ready to share in the next few weeks to help organizers promote their events and encourage more people to sign up to host events in new locations.

This will eventually grow into a full-featured site with resources, an organizer kit, guidelines, and more.

The map site is open source and contributions are welcome!

## Adding an event

To add your event to the map, open a GitHub Issue using the [**New Event**](https://github.com/processing/processing-community-day/issues/new?template=new-event.yml) template.

A script will automatically validate your submission and create a pull request. If there are errors (missing fields, invalid dates, etc.), you'll receive friendly error messages. Once the validation passes, a maintainer will review and merge the PR, and your event will appear on the map.

If you have any questions or need help, feel free to ask in the [forum thread](https://discourse.processing.org/t/pcd-worldwide-2026/48081) or join the [Processing Foundation Discord server](https://discord.gg/q5NksnwGsY).
