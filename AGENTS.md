# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI agents when working with code in this repository.

When making changes to the codebase, please also update this file as needed to reflect any new patterns, tools, or workflows that agents should be aware of. Especially when refactors or architectural changes are made, please update the "Architecture" and "Tech Stack" sections to reflect the new structure and technologies used in the project.

## Project Overview

Static website for Processing Community Day (PCD) 2026 — a global map of events. Built with Astro 5 (static output) + Vue 3 + Leaflet. No database or application backend. Event content is static; the event-list sidebar loads the public Discourse feed at runtime through a fixed proxy.

The Astro project root is `pcd-website/`. All build commands run from there.

## Build Commands

All from the `pcd-website/` directory:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev      # localhost:4321
npm run build    # production build → dist/
npm run preview  # preview production build
```

There are currently no lint scripts configured.

## Tests

See [TEST.md](TEST.md) for the full test inventory and coverage notes.

### Running tests

```sh
node --test .github/scripts/event-issue-helpers.test.mjs
node --test .github/scripts/process-new-event-issue.test.mjs
node --test .github/scripts/process-edit-event-issue.test.mjs
node --test .github/scripts/plus-code.test.mjs
node --test .github/scripts/zines.test.mjs
node --test .github/scripts/zine-build.test.mjs
node --test .github/scripts/process-new-zine-issue.test.mjs

# Requires npm run build from pcd-website/ first:
node --test .github/scripts/data-json.test.mjs
```

Need to run the tests end-to-end? `./scripts/run-tests.sh` executes the helper, event and zine intake, plus-code, and zine metadata suites; runs the zine fixture build; builds the Astro site via `npm --prefix pcd-website run build`; and then runs `data-json.test.mjs` in sequence. Run this script from the repo root after installing dependencies so you get the full battery of checks in one shot.

No install needed — `open-location-code` is already available at `pcd-website/node_modules/`.

### Testing protocol

- Tests live alongside the code they test in `.github/scripts/`.
- Use `node:test` + `node:assert` (built into Node — no test framework needed).
- Build-test assertions for shared icons should allow extra SVG attributes, attribute reordering, and either self-closing or paired path tags; scope checks to the relevant control.
- Mock `globalThis.fetch` with `beforeEach`/`afterEach` for any test that triggers a Nominatim call; always restore the original after each test.
- When adding new functions to `.github/scripts/`, extract pure/testable logic into a separate `*.mjs` module (as was done for `plus-code.mjs`) so it can be imported without triggering the main script's top-level side effects.

## Architecture

### Astro + Vue split

- **Astro** owns routing, layouts, metadata, and static content pages. `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` provides the document shell; `MapLayout.astro`, `SiteLayout.astro`, and `DocsLayout.astro` provide the map, standard content, and Organizer Kit shells respectively.
- The Organizer Kit introduction lives in `src/content/organizer-kit/getting-started/introduction.md`; `/organize/` redirects to its canonical `/organize/getting-started/introduction/` route.
- **Vue** handles the interactive map UI as `client:only="vue"` island components. Map-specific interactive features belong in Vue; static site and Organizer Kit pages belong in Astro and Markdown content collections. The map filter drawer in `MapView.vue` filters clustered markers by date (future, past, or all), format, and activity type; checkbox choices are ORed within a group and filter groups are ANDed together.

### Event list

`/events/` is an Astro page with build-time event cards and a bundled browser script for search, confirmation filters, and accessible Upcoming/Past/Other events tabs. Cmd+K or Ctrl+K focuses the event search and selects its current text; a platform-specific shortcut indicator (⌘K or Ctrl+K) appears inside the input at the right edge and is hidden on mobile. Its English copy follows the static site pages. `src/lib/event-list.mjs` contains shared pure filtering and date-heading logic; `src/styles/event-list.css` owns its presentation. Dates use the visitor's local calendar day and refresh while the page stays open. Multi-day events remain upcoming through their end date and group under Today while ongoing; undated events appear exclusively in the “Other events” tab during normal browsing. A non-empty search keeps the selected tab as its primary result set, including that tab's empty state, then shows matches from other date categories in a labeled section below; confirmation filters still apply to every match. Date headings sit above card groups on a vertical timeline. Cards show date and time above the title; missing times are omitted for past events. Upcoming sorts ascending by date; Past sorts descending by date so the most recent events appear first; Other events sorts by event name. The `filter-16` icon opens a labeled native disclosure at the right of the tab bar; search sits below the tabs. Its dropdown applies time, location, and description criteria directly, with no master toggle. Date availability is controlled by the tabs, so it has no filter checkbox. All criteria start unchecked; clearing filters unchecks them. Selecting any criterion excludes placeholders and requires every selected field, and treats a location as a physical address or online event URL. This UI definition does not change `/data.json` eligibility.

`src/components/SkeletonLoader.astro` provides event-card and forum-thread placeholders, with reduced-motion support. Both loaders wait 150 ms before appearing, and completion cancels pending display. Forum placeholders share row, metadata, and avatar styles with real threads to preserve spacing. Event skeletons cover client initialization only; static events remain available without JavaScript and return on window load if initialization fails. Forum skeletons cover each runtime request, including retries, and clear on success, empty responses, and errors.

`src/components/EventListSidebar.astro` renders the submission link (tracked as `Event List Submit Event Button Click` through the shared analytics helper), a 3:2 rectangular CARTO map preview linking to the map, with matching centered crops for the tile and event dots to preserve geographic proportions, and recent PCD forum threads. Forum data is fetched by the browser (never at build time) from `/api/pcd-forum`. `netlify.toml` proxies that exact route to the public Discourse PCD tag JSON feed; `astro.config.mjs` supplies a matching Vite development proxy. Plain `astro preview` does not run this proxy; use `npm run dev` or Netlify to verify the live feed. No API key is required. Keep this a fixed destination, not an open proxy. `src/lib/forum-topics.mjs` validates the response and sorts by `bumped_at` (fallback `last_posted_at`) so pinned topics cannot override activity order. Thread metadata includes up to five overlapping participant avatars, replies (`posts_count - 1`, matching Discourse’s topic list), and relative activity timestamps refreshed every minute with exact dates in tooltips. Avatars resolve from the response’s users and posters, with initials as a fallback. Titles are inserted as text, with loading, empty, error, retry, and direct-forum-link states. The sidebar moves below the list on small screens.

`EventForumThread.vue` renders forum metadata with a slotted hero button when `forum_thread_url` exists. Hero actions sit in a rounded light-grey box with a localized title bar (“Join this PCD” for upcoming events, “More about this PCD” for past events in English), below the date/venue info card and above “About the event”. When both event-page and forum URLs exist, the hero shows equal-width Event Page and Forum Thread buttons (stacked at 640px and below) with metadata below the forum button; forum-only events show the button beside its metadata, wrapping on narrow screens. The venue/address follows the date row. The localized “About the event” section follows with the description and icon-free activity tags (outside the expandable description), then the rounded minimap. The minimap’s top-right directions button links to OpenStreetMap; keep the button outside the map’s aria-hidden region and above its interaction shield. Contact email appears as a mailto link in the disclaimer using i18n named slots; Foundation events retain a contact sentence without the independence disclaimer. The info card uses 40px outlined icon boxes, a localized month/day date badge, stacked primary and secondary date/location text, and 16px row spacing. The calendar action sits to the right of the date details with its dropdown aligned to the right edge; it is hidden for undated events and replaced by a localized “Past event” label after the end date (or start date for single-day events), using the visitor’s local calendar day. Forum metadata includes participant avatars, replies, and relative activity. Its compact 28px-high metadata slot keeps loaded data and skeletons on one row and reserves space immediately (including for retries and failures), while avatar/text skeletons appear after 150 ms using the event-list pulse and reduced-motion behavior. It omits the thread title and loads participants, replies, and activity through `/api/pcd-forum-topic/:id` (fixed Discourse origin; matching Netlify and Vite proxies). `forum-topics.mjs` validates topic URLs and payloads. Requests time out after ten seconds and abort on unmount; failures preserve the visit link and offer retry. Plain Astro preview does not proxy these requests.

### Data loading at build time

Event data lives in `src/content/events/<event-id>/`:
- `metadata.json` — event fields (id, uid, name, location, dates, organizers, etc.)
- `content.md` — markdown body (frontmatter must include `id:` and `uid:`)
  - `uid:` values in frontmatter **must always be quoted** (`uid: "abc1234"`) because unquoted hex strings like `1e46977` are parsed as scientific notation by YAML, destroying the value.

`src/lib/nodes.ts` loads all events at Astro build time using `import.meta.glob()` + `getCollection('events')`, validates plus codes with `OpenLocationCode`, decodes lat/lng, and returns a sorted `Node[]` array passed as props to `<MapView>`.

Zine cards live in `src/content/zines/<slug>/` and the library grid at `/organize/zines/zine-library/` is built dynamically from every `*/index.md`, sorted by its required numeric `order` frontmatter. Every published zine has `index.md`, `metadata.json`, an optional root-level cover image, and a `downloads/` directory. Metadata uses a non-empty generic `downloads` array: local records are `{ file, file_size, role? }` (where `file` is a basename in `downloads/`), and manually maintained external records use `{ url, filename, file_size, role? }`; roles are optionally `reader-order` or `print-ready`. Metadata also requires an event-style `intake` object with `issue_number`, `submitted_by_github`, `submitted_date`, and `maintainer_notes`; the zine detail page links the submitted date to the issue and the username to the submitter's GitHub profile. Root image imports are covers only; opaque downloads import from `*/downloads/` using `?url&no-inline`, while image downloads are emitted from that same directory via Astro's image asset helper. Set optional `created_by_url` in metadata to an http(s) page for the credited creator(s); the detail page links the author name when it is present. Optional `tags` and `languages` are arrays of non-empty strings. Optional `activity_type` describes how the guide is used, while `zine_format` describes publication structure; do not combine them under a generic `format` field. Cover metadata uses `{ "src": "cover.png", "alt": "..." }`. Zines must use `index.md` (not `content.md`) so Astro's glob loader makes the entry id equal to the folder slug. A zine without a cover renders a grey title fallback in the library and detail page.

The `Zine Intake` workflow produces final content directly in `src/content/zines/<slug>/`. Submitters attach files only through GitHub issue-form fields: exactly one reader-order PDF and one print-ready PDF, optional PNG/JPG/JPEG/WebP cover, and optional PDF/ZIP/image/TXT/MD/CSV/JSON supplements. The limits are ten files total, 25 MB per non-image, 10 MB per image, and 50 MB total. Attachment URLs must be GitHub uploads; both Markdown upload links/images and GitHub-generated HTML `<img>` embeds are accepted. When an embedded image URL has no filename, the workflow derives its extension from the validated file signature. The workflow follows only approved GitHub object-store redirects, validates signatures/UTF-8/JSON content, assigns title-derived cover alt text, and writes original filenames (with lowercase extensions) into `downloads/`. Cover and download filenames are separate namespaces, while download filenames must be case-insensitively unique. It builds the Astro site before force-updating the automation-owned `automation/new-zine-<issue-number>` review branch. An invalid later edit preserves the last valid PR commit, marks the PR `needs changes`, and a subsequent valid edit restores `needs review`; maintainer notes are retained in the PR body. Review PDFs for selectable text, logical reading order, document title and language, tagged headings where possible, alt text, and at least one screen-reader-friendly reading-order version.

The global Markdown pipeline runs `rehype-table-wrapper` and `rehype-heading-anchors`, which respectively wrap rendered tables in `.table-wrapper` and add permalink anchors to h2–h6. Their presentation styles live in the shared `prose.css` layer, scoped to both `.prose` and `.docs-prose`, because both plugins apply to all Markdown collections. For a styled caption immediately after a Markdown image, use `<span class="prose-figure-caption">…</span>` on the next line; it supports normal Markdown links for attribution.

**If a plus_code is invalid or too short, the build fails with a clear error — this is intentional.**

**"Confirmed" events in data.json:** An event is included in the `/data.json` feed if it is present in `loadNodes()` and has no `placeholder: true` flag. There are currently no other event states (draft, hidden, etc.). If new states are added in future, the filter in `src/pages/data.json.ts` must be updated explicitly.

### Key implementation details

- **Leaflet CSS** is loaded via `<link>` tags in `MapLayout.astro`, NOT via JS imports — avoids SSR issues since MapView is `client:only="vue"`.
- **Mobile Organizer Kit navigation** lives in the shared header below 641px: “Organize” becomes a native “Organizer Kit” disclosure populated by `getKitNav()`, with nested section disclosures and 48px touch targets. The separate docs navigation is hidden at that breakpoint; tablet and desktop navigation remain in the docs shell. Keep both navigation trees sourced from `getKitNav()`.
- **Docs page share actions** render `ShareMenu.vue` with `client:load` so the control is present in the initial HTML and hydrates immediately. Keep `vue-i18n` in Vite's `ssr.noExternal` list so this server render can resolve its compile-time feature flags.
- **Browser storage** must be accessed through `src/lib/safeStorage.mjs`; direct `localStorage` property access can throw under iOS privacy restrictions and abort Vue island hydration.
- **Transient feedback** uses `Snackbar.vue`. Pass a translated message and close label, and mount each new notification with a unique `key` so its dismiss timeout and circular timer restart. Snackbar close controls and modal close controls share the global `.modal-close-button` style from `base.css`.
- **`open-location-code`** exports `{ OpenLocationCode }` as a named export — use `new OpenLocationCode()` (not static methods).
- **`leaflet.markercluster`** causes a circular dependency warning, suppressed via `rollupOptions.onwarn` in `astro.config.mjs`.
- **Deep linking:** `?event=<id-or-uid>` query param auto-opens the event detail panel. Both the slug `id` and the short `uid` are accepted.
- **Event UIDs:** Each event has a stable 7-char hex `uid` stored in both `metadata.json` and `content.md` frontmatter. UIDs never change after creation. Three static URL formats are generated per event: `/event/<slug>` (redirects to canonical), `/event/<slug>-<uid>` (canonical, has OG tags, redirects into SPA), and `/event/<uid>` (short form, redirects to canonical). The canonical URL is what the share button copies.

Every event shows a “Processing Community Day” eyebrow above its title in both `NodePanel.vue` and Leaflet popups (`src/lib/popup.ts`), using the shared `panel.event_eyebrow` translation key.

| `src/i18n/locales/*.json` | Per-language translations (es, de, fr, pt, zh-TW, zh-CN, ja, ko) |

## Internationalization (i18n)

The site uses `vue-i18n@11` with 9 supported locales: `en`, `es`, `de`, `fr`, `pt`, `zh-TW`, `zh-CN`, `ja`, `ko`.

### How it's wired up

- `vue-i18n` is installed globally via `astro.config.mjs` → `vue({ appEntrypoint: '/src/i18n/vuePlugin' })`.
- Locale detection order: localStorage (`pcd-locale`) → `navigator.language` → `'en'`.
- The active locale is a reactive singleton (`currentLocale` ref in `localeState.ts`) shared across all components.

### Adding or changing UI strings

1. **Always add the key to `en.json` first.** It is the source of truth and the fallback for all other locales.
2. Add the same key to every other locale file in `src/i18n/locales/`. Missing keys fall back to English silently.
3. In Vue components, use `const { t, locale } = useI18n()` and replace hardcoded text with `t('key')`.
4. In non-component TS files (e.g. `popup.ts`), use `i18n.global.t('key')` imported from `src/i18n/index.ts`.
5. Pass `locale` (or `locale.value` as a string) to `formatDateRange()`, `formatDate()`, etc. for locale-aware date formatting.

### What NOT to translate

Event data coming from content files — `event_name`, `details_text`, `city`, `country`, `organization_name`, organizer names, URLs — must never be wrapped in `t()`. Only static UI strings get translated.

### Non-English word choices

Non-English locales use "Events" (not "Nodes") in list/dialog labels, since "Nodes" is a technical term that doesn't translate naturally.

## Global Configuration (`src/config.ts`)

Use `src/config.ts` for static, non-secret values that are referenced across multiple files or are likely to change. Import from it rather than hardcoding inline.

**Store here:**
- Contact emails (e.g. `PCD_EMAIL`)
- Stable URLs referenced in UI (e.g. a feedback form link)
- Project-wide constants (e.g. site name, org name)

**Do not store here:**
- Environment-specific or secret values — use `.env` with `import.meta.env` for those
- Anything already defined in `astro.config.mjs` (e.g. base path)
- Component-local constants that aren't shared

For local map development, `pcd-website/.env` may define `PUBLIC_CARTO_API_KEY`. During `npm run dev`, all CARTO raster tile URLs append it as the `key` query parameter; production builds do not embed it.

## UI / Styling Rules

- Do not use diagonal arrows for internal links; use a right-pointing arrow when a directional indicator is needed.

- The site is light-mode only — there is no dark mode, no `[data-theme]` toggling, and no theme-related CSS. Do not reintroduce it without an explicit decision to do so.

## Accessibility

Must follow standard accessibility best practices (semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, focus management) for all interactive components (map, panels, buttons, etc.). WCAG 2.1 AA compliance is the goal.

## Event Submission Workflow

### New events

New events are submitted via GitHub Issues using `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/01-new-event.yml`. The workflow `.github/workflows/new-event-intake.yml` (`process-new-event` job) runs `.github/scripts/process-new-event-issue.mjs` to validate the issue and, if valid, opens a PR with generated `metadata.json` + `content.md` files. A stable `uid` is generated at intake and written into both files.

### Edit events

When an edit changes the address but retains the same resolved Plus Code, both the issue confirmation and PR body show a warning linking to the Plus Code so organizers can verify the map location. Comparison trims addresses and normalizes Plus Code case and whitespace. Edit the shared copy in `LOCATION_WARNING_TEMPLATE` in `.github/workflows/new-event-intake.yml`; `{plus_code_url}` and `{issue_reference}` are substituted by the edit script. Direct script runs must supply this environment variable when an address-change warning is needed.

PR confirmation comments use separate initial-submission and event-update messages, selected by the validated edit job output. Both confirmations and PR bodies mention the issue author, remind them to keep their community posted on their forum thread (linked when a URL is available), and link to the Organizer Kit. Only event updates include the canonical event-page update notice; initial submission confirmations explain that the event will be added to the map after merge.

When a valid edit produces no PR because the generated files already match the site, the `create-pr` job upserts the shared status comment with the canonical event link and a short note about the form workaround. This feedback runs only after successful PR creation returns operation `none` without a PR number; failures and existing PRs must not be described as unchanged submissions.

Organizers can edit existing events via `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/04-edit-event.yml`. The same workflow (`process-edit-event` job) runs `.github/scripts/process-edit-event-issue.mjs`. The edit script: reads the existing event by `event_id`, preserves the immutable `uid` and `intake` block, preserves `event_activities` if all checkboxes are unchecked (GitHub issue forms cannot prefill checkboxes), and preserves `content.md` if `full_description` is blank.

### New zines

New zines use `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/05-new-zine.yml` and `.github/workflows/new-zine-intake.yml`. The workflow runs `.github/scripts/process-new-zine-issue.mjs` when an issue labelled `new zine` is opened, edited, reopened, or labelled. It validates and downloads attachments, generates final published files with an event-style `intake` provenance block, builds the site, and force-updates the stable automation-owned `automation/new-zine-<issue-number>` review PR. It upserts one marked status comment; invalid edits leave an existing valid PR unchanged. Zines have no edit issue workflow.

### Shared helpers

Pure functions shared by both intake scripts live in `.github/scripts/event-issue-helpers.mjs`. This includes `parseIssueSections`, validation helpers, `slugify`, `parseActivities`, `parseOrganizers`, `buildValidationComment`, and `generateUniqueUid`.

### Template detection

Intake scripts guard against running on the wrong template:
- `process-new-event-issue.mjs` skips if the body contains `### Event ID` (unique to the edit template)
- `process-edit-event-issue.mjs` skips if the body does NOT contain `### Event ID`
- `process-new-zine-issue.mjs` skips unless the body contains `### Reader-order PDF` (which also matches the former `### Reader-order PDF URL` heading)

## Deployment

Netlify, configured via `netlify.toml`. The site deploys to `https://day.processing.org/` on push to `main`.

The browser-facing CARTO tile key is supplied at build time through
`PUBLIC_CARTO_API_KEY`. Configure it as a Netlify environment variable with
Builds scope; for local development it may be placed in `pcd-website/.env`.
Never commit the key. Without it, the site falls back to unkeyed tile URLs for
local development and may display CARTO's API-key watermark.
